# Logging Examples

### This repo is a collection of scripts as I learn more about logging for both Python applications and for MLOPs

### Instructions

* Clone Repo
* Create virtualenv, e.g., `python -m venv .env`; `source .env/bin/activate`
* Install dependencies: `pip install requirements.txt`. Note: M1 users: `pip install requirements.txt.m1` (the only difference is `tensorflow-macos`)
* Run ml training `python run_ml.py`
* Run ml tests `python test_ml.py`
